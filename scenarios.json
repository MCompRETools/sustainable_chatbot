      "difficulty": "Undergraduate",
      "context": "A multinational corporation is upgrading its entire digital infrastructure (10,000+ devices). The IT department wants to buy the newest, most energy-efficient models and simply recycle the old ones through a third-party vendor.",
      "problem_statement": "Recycling is energy-intensive and often leads to toxic leakage. How would you design a circular strategy that goes beyond simple recycling?",

      "ai_hints": [
        "Ask about the energy cost of raw material extraction for new devices.",

      "difficulty": "Postgraduate",
      "context": "A city council implements an AI-driven traffic system to reduce vehicle emissions by 15%. However, the real-time processing doubles the electricity consumption of the local data center.",
